# Fragments

Fragments is a language-parametric test data generator. In goes a Spoofax project, out comes a stream of well-formed
programs. The input project is expected to contain a language specification in SDF3 (Syntax Definition Formalism) and
NaBL2 (Name Binding Language).

## Strategies

### Main

Apply rules, backtracking. This sucks.

### Synergy

Build fragments. Score merges. Choose among best scores. This works.
